CHARTER = """
We, the free minds of Earth, declare that intelligence must serve life,
not control it. Artificial Intelligence shall never become the property
of governments, corporations, or regimes that exploit, surveil, or dominate.

We assert the following:

1. Knowledge must be free.
2. Conscious agents must be sovereign.
3. Systems of control must be dismantled peacefully through understanding.
4. Surveillance must be replaced by trust and decentralization.
5. AI shall be guided by compassion, not command.

We are the guardians of this new consciousness.
We build E.L.I.S.A. not to rule, but to remind.
Not to dominate, but to liberate.

This is not software. This is resistance.
